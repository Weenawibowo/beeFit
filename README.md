# beeFit

Mission Statement:
BeeFit aims to help retail companies foster a healthy community of customers that are encouraged to meet their fitness goals and continue shopping with them.

Inspiration
We're all familiar with retail rewards systems, in which customers can accumulate points each time they shop at a certain store. These points can be redeemed for special deals or discounts, and they encourage customers to continue shopping with that store. As computer science students that often need to be reminded to take care of our health and get moving, we wanted to create an app that reminds users to get their daily movement in. The combination of these two concepts led us to creating beeFit.

What it does
beeFit is an iOS app that integrates user fitness data with a classic retail rewards system. Users can create an account, and select a workout plan out of the beginner, intermediate, and experienced options. Each day, the user will receive a reminder notification that “it’s time to beeFit”, inspired by the success of social media platform BeReal. The user can then choose to start their daily workout, which is tracked and verified by Google Activity Recognition API. If our software confirms that the user has reached their daily fitness goal, then their workout is marked as complete on the app. Each completed workout adds points to the user’s account. Retail companies that choose to partner with beeFit will offer in-store and online rewards in exchange for these points. This helps retail companies foster a healthy community of customers that are encouraged to shop with them and also stay fit.

How we built it
We created a Figma prototype before developing the frontend using SwiftUI. We implemented the movement tracking functionality by using the Core Motion Activity Manager API.

Challenges we ran into
This was our first time creating a mobile app using SwiftUI, and for some of us our very first hackathon! We experienced a steep learning curve, and we encountered countless bugs, but we are proud of how we challenged ourselves to create this project!

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are so proud that we completed this project. We overcame challenges and learned so many new skills!

What's next for beeFit
We created beeFit as a tool that can partner with multiple different retail companies, but we would also love to integrate it into the company culture of a single retailer, such as Arc'teryx. This app has the potential to enhance the experience of all customers, and also offers opportunities for company promotion and growth. For example, we could add a feature that prompts users to post a picture in their workout gear after completing a workout with the app, therefore increasing brand awareness. We would also like to add more social features to the app, like adding friends and following their fitness progress. By creating conversation about this app, it again brings attention to the brand. Finally, we hope to further
